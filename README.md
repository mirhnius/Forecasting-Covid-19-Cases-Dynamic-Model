# Forecasting-Covid-19-Cases-Dynamic-Model
In this analytical project, we apply a dynamic mathematical model for forecasting the probability of healthy people in terms of time and number

According to the latest report of the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019?adgroupsurvey={adgroupsurvey}&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0K-HBhDDARIsAFJ6UGgVmQxpm7p_xVY4alDUm-5_Rf7kfpIMt2Wa_VTWYjxzrFv5_8zpu2UaAq28EALw_wcB), the outbreak of Covid-19 disease has passed from the epidemic stage to the global stage. In epidemiology, a dynamic model is used to predict the prevalence of the disease, which gives changes in the probability of the number of healthy individuals.
Here is the applied model:
